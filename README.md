# Playground

## Sources of some experiments

### [Strong type](sources/strong_type/strong_type.md)

Facilities tentative to handle type with a strong semantic.

### [Cuppa](sources/cuppa/cuppa.md)

C++ prototyping facilities (simple media management). Windows specific until further notice.

### [Grammar](sources/grammar/grammar.md)

Experiment of compile time expression to analyse strings.

### [Constraint](sources/constraint/constraint.md)

Tentative to add some constraints on function parameters, return value...

### [Non integral enum](sources/nonintegral_enum/nonintegral_enum.md)

Implementation of an enumeration type in which values are not numeric... they are types.

### [Wit](sources/wit/wit.md)

A framework to ease c++ development... humbly trying to fill some gaps in the standard library. 

### [TDD](sources/tdd/tdd.md)

A very simple, and incomplete test framework, but it is very light and fast.

### Misc

#### covariant

Demonstrate covariance in C++

#### deconstify

Tentative to ease the create of const and non const getter (hiding the use of const_cast to the user).

#### fsm

FX curious finite state machine.
State is a function which returns the next state.
It is not my vision of how a state machine should be managed, but in some way it is a kind of fun and tricky.

#### recursive_helper

Abandonned

#### magic

Misc transient experiments...

#### static_config

Tentative of multiple configuration initialisation using the preprocessor as little as possible.
